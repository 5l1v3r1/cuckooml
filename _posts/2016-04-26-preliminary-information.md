## Issues to consider ##
- How to set up the development environment? I was thinking about virtual machine with Lubuntu; is there any online tutorial about developing Cuckoo?<!--more-->
- Is there any coding guideline; am I supposed to use the Python coding guideline? What about documentation; any tips?
- Which data should I use for the initial development? Should we start with static dataset; maybe the sample that I used for writing the proposal? At some point it was mentioned that some kind of online learning will be required, should I worry about it now?
- Should the development be integrated into Cuckoo straight away or should I start writing it as a standalone application at first?

## Short term plan ##
Once the development environment gets sorted I'd like to use some basic clustering algorithm and focus on **features extraction**. This naturally leads to defining the clustering goals and similarity metrics (heuristics).

Any comments are welcomed.
